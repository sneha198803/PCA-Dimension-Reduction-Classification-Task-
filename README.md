# PCA-Dimension-Reduction-Classification-Task-

Data file name: Dry_Bean_Dataset_Final.csv

Seven different types of dry beans were used, taking into account the features such as form, shape, type, and structure by the market situation. A total of 16 features; 12 dimensions, and 4 shape forms, were obtained from the grains.

a) Plot the first two dimensions PCA

b) Use the first n PCA which 95% variance covered as inputs to apply classification algorithms, present, TP Rate, FP Rate, Precision, Recall, F-Measure, Confusion matrix and Classification rate

c) Compare the classification results from b) with the results with original features
